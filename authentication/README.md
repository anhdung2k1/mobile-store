# Documentation Authentication Java-Spring Boot API

- Technical:
    - Docker MySQL database installed in Docker Container
    - Set up account for using database: messager/messager
    - Spring Boot
    - Spring Security
    - JWT
    - Java environment (Java ver 17)
- Build: Maven 3.9.1
- Hibernate Core ORM: Hibernate

<h2>HOW TO RUN</h2> 

1. Cat the host in mysql_container by
```
docker exec -it mysql_container bash
```
```
cat /etc/hosts
```
It will show the host address IPv4 mysql is running --> In this point, we are going to use 172.21.0.3 IP address <br/>
2. Configure in docker-compose.yml file and ChatServerService.cpp file located in socket-server and change the IP communication to 172.21.0.3 <br/>
3. Checking the pwd directory path in each context in docker-compose.yml file and make a change point to right directory <br/>
4. Start a docker-compose.yml Java API by
```
docker-compose up authentication
```
- It will start the <strong>localhost:8080</strong> API

If you change your java code, you must "build" it before "up" it by
```
docker-compose build authentication
```

# How to make an API Requests from terminal (CURL Command)
---
<a>Prerequisites</a>
---
- Environment:
    - Linux
    - Curl
- Command going to use to make a test API
```
curl [options] [URL...]
```
- HTTP GET
    - The GET method requests a specific resource from the localhost:8080 server
    - GET is the default method when making HTTP requests with <strong>curl</strong>
```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/api/accounts -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```
To filter result use query params:
```
$ curl http://localhost:8080/api/accounts?acc_id=1 -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```

- HTTP POST
    - The POST method is used to create a resource on the server (localhost:8080). If the resource exists, it is overridden
    - The following command make <strong>POST request</strong> using the data specified with the ```-d ``` option:
```
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/accounts/signup -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"userName": "anhdung", "password": "anhdung"}'
```
- This command will return the response from the server that you made request. In this circumstances, the response we are going to get is a token <ACCESS_TOKEN>
- Using this token detached in Header for each request --> Authenticate each Filter request when making API call to inner Application
- HTTP PUT:
    - The PUT method is used to update or replace a resource on a server. It replaces all data of the specified resource with the request data.
```
$ curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/users/1 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"address":"address1", "gender": "MALE"}' -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>"
```
- HTTP DELETE:
    - The DELETE method is used ti removes the specified resource from the server
```
$ curl -X DELETE http://localhost:80808/api/user/1
```

<a>Documentation Overview</a>
1. The "Spring Web MVC Framework"
2. Spring Security

<a>1/ The "Spring Web MVC Framework"</a>
---
- The <a>Spring Web MVC framework</a> (often referred to as "Spring MVC") is a rich "model view controller" web framework <br/> 
- Spring MVC lets you create special ```@RestController``` beans to handle incoming HTTP requests. Methods in your controller are mapped to HTTP by using ```@RequestMapping``` annotations.<br/>

- If you want to take complete control of ```Spring MVC```, you can add your own ```@Configuration``` annotated. You can set your own ```@Bean``` Configuration putting on ```IOC``` container.
- To use it by <strong>Dependency Injection (DI)</strong> just use annotation ```@Autowired``` --> This will load the <strong>Bean</strong> that you have already defined.
- In the ```Services``` layer --> Will incharge on handle logic API 
- In the ```Repository``` layer --> Handling and Interacting connect with Database
- Define new model and entity --> Start application --> Auto generate with specific properties. <br/>
---
<a>2/ Spring Security</a>
---
- When added the Spring Security Framework to application, it automatically registers a filter chain that intercept all incoming requests. This chain consists of various filters, and each of them handles a particular use case
- Check if the requested URL is publicly accessible, based on configuration
- In case of session-based authentication, check if the user is already authenticated in the current session
- Check if the user is authorized to perform the requested action, and so on <br/>

<a><h4>AuthenticationManager</h4></a>
- ```AuthenticationManager``` as a coordinator where you can register multiple providers, and based on request type, it will deliver an authentication request to the correct provider

<a><h4>AuthenticationProvider</h4></a>
- ```AuthenticationProvider``` process specific types of authentication.
    -  ```authenticate```performs authentication with the request
    - ```DaoAuthenticationProvider``` retrieves user details from ```UserDetailsService```

<a><h4>UserDetailsService</h4></a>
- ```UserDetailService``` is described as a core interface that loads user-specific data.
- Extracting user identity information based on credentials from a database and then perform validation
- ```loadUserByUsername``` accepts username as a parameter and returns the user identity object

<a><h4>Authentication Using JWT with Spring Security</h4></a>
- To customize Spring Security for JWT use, we need a configuration class annotated with ```@EnableWebSecurity``` annotation in our classpath.
1. Configure the authentication manager with the correct provider
2. Configure web security (public URLs, private URLs, authorization, etc)

```
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class SecurityConfiguration {
    private final JwtAuthenticationFilter jwtAuthenticationFilter;
    private final AuthenticationProvider authenticationProvider;

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception{
        //Code
    }
}
```
- Add JwtFilterToken filter before each HTTP Request
- Hashing password when user are registered a new account
- Token will valid in setting duration, if token is running out of time --> the application will need to reauthenticate to continue use
